### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Junaid.
![junaid](https://github.com/junaiddodhia/junaiddodhia/blob/main/junaid.jpeg)
I usually engineer software, occasionally write documents and always tell stories. Iâ€™m a fan of white space, personal space and outer space. I like jokes too.

I have been in the technology space as a student, a software engineer and a coding instructor. I received my **Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Mumbai** and my **Master's in Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon University**.

In the space of technology, my interests lie in **APIs, Developer Documentation and System Design**. I enjoy front end development as well. However, CSS hurts my brain sometimes. It's not that bad. I can manage it. In the space of writing and storytelling, I admire David Foster Wallace, Ernest Hemingway, Charles Bukowski and beyond.
