👋🏻 Hi,I’m Junaid — an engineer, designer, and writer who values results, white space, personal space, and outer space. I like jokes too. Over the years, I’ve built scalable systems at Pipekit (an early-stage Y Combinator startup), contributed design solutions at Material in Motion, and taught emerging tech skills as an instructor at Coding Minds Academy.

I hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from the University of Mumbai and a Master’s in Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon University. Outside of work, I’m drawn to tennis, cinema, philosophy, comedy, ed tech, and architecture.
