Hi, I’m Junaid, an engineer-turned-designer. I was an early engineer at YC-backed pipekit.io, hold a Master’s in Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon, and teach coding at Pacific Preparatory and Maven. I’m passionate about shaping tools that shape us, with a growing interest in AI’s practical potential. I enjoy tennis, good questions, and better jokes.
