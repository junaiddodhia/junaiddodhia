### Hi, Iâ€™m Junaid ðŸ‘‹ 

I enjoy designing experiences, writing code, and telling stories. Iâ€™m a fan of white space, personal space and outer space. I like jokes too.

My tech career has been multifaceted: from student to engineer, coding instructor, and designer. Through it all, my love for design has remained constant. Iâ€™m often told I have a sharp eye for detail while maintaining a strong sense of the bigger picture. What excites me most is crafting seamless, intuitive experiences that just work. I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Mumbai and a Masterâ€™s in Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon University. My favorite courses were Distributed System, API Design and Designing Human Centered Software.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m an avid tennis player, and youâ€™ll find me on the court most days. Iâ€™m also deeply interested in cinema, philosophy, comedy, ed tech, APIs, developer docs, cats, sunsets and architecture.
