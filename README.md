### Hi, Iâ€™m Junaid ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Junaid. I design experiences, write code, and tell stories. Iâ€™m a fan of white space, personal space and outer space. I like jokes too.

Over the course of my tech career, Iâ€™ve worn many hats: from student to engineer, coding instructor, and designer. What has remained constant is my love for design. Iâ€™m known for having a sharp eye for detail while never losing sight of the bigger picture. My mission is to craft intuitive, seamless experiences that simply work. I believe in reducing cognitive load, humanizing interactions to reflect authentic human intentions, and narrowing the gap between intent and impact.

I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Mumbai and a Masterâ€™s in Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon University. My academic highlights include courses on Distributed Systems, API Design, and Human-Centered Software Design.

Iâ€™m also deeply interested in tennis, cinema, philosophy, comedy, ed tech, APIs, developer docs, cats, sunsets, and architecture.
