### Hi, I’m Junaid 

I’m Junaid—an engineer, designer, and writer committed to delivering results. I’m a fan of white space, personal space, and outer space. I like jokes too.

Throughout my tech career, I’ve been a student, engineer, designer, and instructor. I aspire to create experiences that simply work by reducing cognitive load, humanizing interactions, and bridging the gap between intent and impact.

I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Mumbai and a Master’s in Information Systems from Carnegie Mellon University. I’m also interested in tennis, cinema, philosophy, comedy, ed tech, and architecture.
